The CropField component is a vaadin Field that shows a single image and overlays it with capabilities to select, transform and move a cropping area within it.

Basically, it is a jCrop clone for Vaadin/GWT.

Features include:
  * adding handlers to be notified when selection changes
  * setting min/max size of the selection
  * forcing an aspect ratio on the selection
  * selecting in the true size coordinate system of scaled images
